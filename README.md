# pi-quiz

A simple quiz game where you have guess as many decimal poins of the pi number as you possibly can.

## Prerequesites

In order to run the game, you need following modules imported:
- sys
- mscvrt (Windows)
- getch (Linux)

## Compabibility

I am a Linux user and developed this project mainly on a Linux machine. I am using the ```getch``` module to get single digit inputs. On Windows, we have to use the ```mscvrt```module which also allows single digit inputs, but won't show which digit you typed. But the game runs like it should be on both machines. Since I don't own a Mac OS machine, I don't have a solution for this OS.
